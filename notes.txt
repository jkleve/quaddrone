avrdude -c dragon_isp -p m2560 -v -e 

From the avr sparkfun example page it's for the atmega326
-U efuse:w:0x05:m -U hfuse:w:0xD6:m -U lfuse:w:0xFF:m

From calculator. Use this but check it first to the datasheet
-U lfuse:w:0x42:m -U hfuse:w:0x99:m -U efuse:w:0xff:m

Full command used
avrdude -c dragon_isp -p m2560 -v -e -U lfuse:w:0x42:m -U hfuse:w:0x99:m -U efuse:w:0xff:m
42 in lfuse for clk/8 (1 MHz)
c2 in lfuse for clk   (8 MHz)

Read fuses
avrdude -c dragon_isp -p m2560 -U lfuse:r:low_fuse_val.hex:h -U hfuse:r:high_fuse_val.hex:h

Step 1
Set fuse bits with above command

Step 2
Program




pin 1 MISO
pin 2 VCC
pin 3 SCK
pin 4 MOSI
pin 5 RST
pin 6 GND

APM
pin 6 S (GND)
pin 4 + (MOSI
pin 2 - (VCC)


The default fuses were
avrdude: safemode: lfuse reads as FF
avrdude: safemode: hfuse reads as D8
avrdude: safemode: efuse reads as FD

I changed them to 
avrdude: safemode: lfuse reads as 42
avrdude: safemode: hfuse reads as 99
avrdude: safemode: efuse reads as FF
avrdude: safemode: Fuses OK (E:FF, H:99, L:42)


0: programmed (enabled), 1: unprogrammed (disabled)
lfuse
* I'm going to use the default (see page 40 of datasheet)
** This is with CLSEL3:0 0b0010 (8 MHz)
** This is with CKDIV8 programmed
*** This divides the clock by 8 so the clock speed will be 1 MHz
* 42: SUT1:0 0b00 (0 ms delay before clock is "stable")
* 52: SUT1:0 0b01 (4.1 ms delay)
* 62: SUT1:0 0b10 (65 ms delay)
* NOTE: I've now switched to 0xC2 instead of 0x42. The C gives 8Mhz instead of 1Mhz
*     updated to 0xE2. Not sure if the 64 ms delay helps at all but switched to default value

hfuse
* BOOTRST: 1
** No bootloader in use
* BOOTSZ1:0 0b11
** gives the maximum size for application software
* EESAVE: 1
** erases EEPROM on chip erase
* WDTON: 1
** if this is programmed (0) watchdog will be enabled
* SPIEN: 0
** serial programming (ISP)
* RSTDSBL: 1
** changes the reset pin to be an I/O pin
