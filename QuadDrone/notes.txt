avrdude -c dragon_isp -p m2560 -v -e 

From the avr sparkfun example page it's for the atmega326
-U efuse:w:0x05:m -U hfuse:w:0xD6:m -U lfuse:w:0xFF:m

From calculator. Use this but check it first to the datasheet
-U lfuse:w:0x42:m -U hfuse:w:0x99:m -U efuse:w:0xff:m

Step 1
Set fuse bits with above command

Step 2
Program




pin 1 MISO
pin 2 VIG
pin 3 SCK
pin 4 MOSI
pin 5 RST
pin 6 GND

APM
pin 2 S
pin 4 +
pin 6 -


The default fuses were
avrdude: safemode: lfuse reads as FF
avrdude: safemode: hfuse reads as D8
avrdude: safemode: efuse reads as FD

I changed them to 
avrdude: safemode: lfuse reads as 42
avrdude: safemode: hfuse reads as 99
avrdude: safemode: efuse reads as FF
avrdude: safemode: Fuses OK (E:FF, H:99, L:42)
